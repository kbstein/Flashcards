# FlashcardsApp

I created this app for a school assignment. The app contains 24 flashcards for learning the elements of the periodic table. 
It implements simple animation features making it intuitive to use.

### Using the App

The app starts with the first flashcard on the element abbreviation side. Shown in the two screenshots below. Swiping to the left flips the card over.

After the card is flipped and now showing the full element name, swiping to the right will flip it back to the abbreviation side while swiping to the left
again will slide the next flashcard onto the screen (shown below).

If the abreviation side of a card is showing, a swipe to the right will slied the previous flashcard back onto the screen.
